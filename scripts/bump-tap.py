"""Rewrite the homebrew formula for a release — asserts, not hope.

The tap bump was the release's last manual step, done by hand four times in
three days: copy a version, copy four sha256 lines, push. A transcription
error there ships a formula brew refuses (checksum mismatch) or, worse,
accepts. This script is the closed loop: it reads the release's own
SHA256SUMS, rewrites exactly the url/sha pairs the formula declares, and
refuses loudly on ANY surprise — a checksum file for the wrong version, a
target the formula wants that the release did not build, a rewrite count
other than what the formula carries, a stale version string surviving.

Idempotent on purpose: re-run against a formula already at the version it
produces byte-identical output, so the workflow's "nothing to commit" path
is how a resumed release run no-ops.

Usage: bump-tap.py <version> <SHA256SUMS> <Formula/relais.rb>
