# Holdout acceptance in relais (pointer)

The plan lives in the decisions repository, which owns ADR-0045
(`work.holdout-acceptance`). This repository carries phases 2–5.

## Decision log

- 2026-10-25 — Phase 2 is parse and preflight only. Successor inheritance
  of the frozen definition (resume, repair, `--widen-scope`, `review-parts`,
  `--rerun-verify`) moves to phase 3, because only phase 3 runs a holdout
  and the successor paths are part of verification. Phase 2 records the
  definition digest in the manifest so that phase 3 can bind to it.
