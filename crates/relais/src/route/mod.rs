//! Routing (SPEC §6): a pure function over validated inputs.
//!
//! Eligibility, risk floors and acceptance are deterministic. Within the
//! eligible profiles, an owned, Relais-trained predictor estimates
//! acceptance and total cost; with insufficient trained evidence the
//! configured conservative baseline runs and outcomes are collected. No
//! silent fallback: unavailable models yield `blocked:model_unavailable`,
//! and unapproved provider substitution stops further dispatch. File
//! count alone never determines risk; complexity and consequence are
//! separate.
